/**
 * This class makes it possible to create radio buttons without having to put
 * them in a dedicated QGroupBox or KButtonGroup. This is useful when you do not
 * want to add visual frames to create a set of radio buttons.
 *
 * It is a QWidget so that it can support KConfigXT: it is completely
 * invisible and does not require the radio buttons to be its children.
 * The most common way to use it is to create your dialog with Designer,
 * including the radio buttons, and to instantiate an instance of
 * InvisibleButtonGroup from your code.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * We assume "config" is a KConfigSkeleton object which contains a
 * "ViewMode" key. This key is an int where 1 means "list" and 2 means
 * "detail".
 * We also assume "ui" has been created with Designer and contains two
 * QRadioButton named "listRadioButton" and "detailRadioButton".
 *
 * @code
 * // Prepare the config dialog
 * KConfigDialog* dialog(parent, "Settings", config);
 *
 * // Create a widget in the dialog
 * QWidget* pageWidget = new QWidget;
 * ui->setupUi(pageWidget);
 * dialog->addPage(pageWidget, i18n("Page Title"));
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now we can setup an InvisibleButtonGroup to handle both radio
 * buttons and ensure they follow the "ViewMode" config key.
 *
 * @code
 * InvisibleButtonGroup* group = new InvisibleButtonGroup(pageWidget);
 * group->setObjectName( QLatin1String("kcfg_ViewMode" ));
 * group->addButton(ui->listRadioButton, 1);
 * group->addButton(ui->detailRadioButton, 2);
 * @endcode
